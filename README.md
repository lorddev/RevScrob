# RevScrob for Windows

This is a Windows service written in C# which uses the Last.fm REST API and the local iTunes COM library to keep your iTunes play counts and last played dates up-to-date. It can be described as a "reverse scrobbler"; instead of updating Last.fm counts with iTunes activity, it goes the other direction.
